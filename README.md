## How to use?
There are two parts to this system

2. Relaying this information to the user's mobile via Twilio Messaging Service. For that, one must configure Twilio
    1. Sign up on [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) using your email id. After verifying your email log into the Twilio Dashboard. For this purpose, we will remain on free trial.
    2. Once you are in the dashboard, click **Get a trial phone number**.
    3. Under Project Info, you can find the **ACCOUNT SID**, **AUTH TOKEN** and **PHONE NUMBER** (Twilio Phone Number and not yours). Make a note of these numbers.
4. After successfully completing above steps, you are good to go.

Once all the above requirements are met, do the following
1. Git clone this repository(if you are techie enough), otherwise download the repository by clicking on **Download ZIP** under **Code**.
2. Open Terminal and change your directory to the folder you have just cloned/ downloaded. (Remember to extract the .zip file if you have downloaded it)
3. Make sure Docker Desktop is running.
4. Run `docker build -t covin --rm .`
5. Run `docker run -it --name covin-schedule --rm covin`
6. Run `python covin_slot_tracker.py <DISTRICT_ID> <TWILIO AUTH TOKEN> <TWILIO ACCOUNT SID> <TWILIO PHONE NUMBER> <YOUR PHONE NUMBER>` in the interactive shell. Make sure your phone number has the country code. eg: +919xxxxxxxx
